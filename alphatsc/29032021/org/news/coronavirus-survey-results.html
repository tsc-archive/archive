            <p class="tsc-body">We conducted this survey in order to allow us to understand the thoughts of our congregation in regards to safely reopening during COVID. We collected your opinions of Phase One, and your opinions on moving into Phase Two over the coming months.</p>
            <h3 class="tsc-heading-m">Moving Online</h3>
            <p class="tsc-body">The first question we asked about Moving Online was can you rate it out of ten.</p>
<img class="covid-img" src="https://tonbridgespiritualist.com/application/assets/covid-survey/moving-online-opinions.png">
            <p class="tsc-body">As you can see the vast majority of people rated Moving Online a 9/10 or 10/10. There were some mid-level reviews and one 1/10 review but this seems to be an outlier as a result of misunderstanding the rating system.</p>
            <p class="tsc-body">We then asked if they had received a message from a medium and if they found our online services (watching a past session and signup for emails) were easy to use.</p>
            <img class="covid-img" src="https://tonbridgespiritualist.com/application/assets/covid-survey/messages-services.png">
            <p class="tsc-body">It is clear that our online services have been created with the user at the core as everyone has found these easy to use, as well as this the majority of people have received a message at one of our virtual sessions.</p>
            <p class="tsc-body">Lastly, we asked if there was anything people didn't like about Moving Online. People mentioned it not having the same feel as a physical session and that technical problems have meant they have missed out on sessions. People also noted being distracted by other people as they face everyone on their screen in a Zoom meeting.</p>
            <h3 class="tsc-heading-m">Moving into Phase Two</h3>
    <p class="tsc-para">Hadlow Parish Council gave the thumbs up for some activities to resume in the Old School Hall from around September, meaning we have the chance to open in October.</p>
    <p class="tsc-para">We asked people if they would consider attending sessions at Hadlow in October (these would of course be following COVID secure guidance).</p>
    <img class="covid-img" src="https://tonbridgespiritualist.com/application/assets/covid-survey/session-in-hadlow.png">
    <p class="tsc-para">Just under three quarters of the survey sample said they would attend in October. With the majority of the final quarter saying that they would consider attending.</p>
    <p class="tsc-body">We then asked about Face Coverings and missing a week. As we would be working to capacity in Hadlow, we would be asking people to skip a week of attending to allow new people to attend.</p>
    <img class="covid-img" src="https://tonbridgespiritualist.com/application/assets/covid-survey/miss-a-week.png">
    <img class="covid-img" src="https://tonbridgespiritualist.com/application/assets/covid-survey/face-covering.png">
    <p class="tsc-body">The majority of people agreed to miss a week with only one person saying they would not want to miss a week and the majority of people would agree to comply with a request to wear a face covering (unless you are exempt).</p>
    <p class="tsc-body">Someone raised a point about allowing people to still participate via Zoom so they don't miss out. We would be planning to open physically fortnightly and offer Zoom sessions in the weeks we are closed. We will be Facebook Livestreaming physical sessions, but participation from home will not be possible. This is only to keep it fair for those physically present.</p>
