<h1 class="tsc-heading-xl">About us</h1>
</div>
<div class="tsc-grid-column-two-thirds">
<p class="tsc-body">Formed just before the First World War by Mrs Pink, Tonbridge Spiritualist Centre, then known as Tonbridge Christian Spiritualist Centre (The Sanctuary of St. Mary) got its start within Mrs Pink's Tonbridge home.</p>
<p class="tsc-body">Over it's 100+ years of service to the people of Tonbridge and the surrounding areas, the centre has evolved massively.
</p>
<p class="tsc-body">Around the time of the millenium, the centre broke it's connection from a spiritual membership and became independent, soon after abolishing the membership fee and welcoming all through the doors.</p>
<p class="tsc-body">The centre's ties to Hadlow began with a weekly healing session in the Old School Hall on a Wednesday, then the centre moved to the Old School Hall for Sunday Divine Services.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading-m">The Centre's Season</h3>
<p class="tsc-body">TSC's season runs from September through to July. Our centre is also closed on days of celebration such as Mothering Sunday and Father's Day. Information about the season can be found on the calendar page.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading-m">About Sunday Divine Services</h3>
<p class="tsc-body">Sunday Divine Services are held at the Old School Hall in Hadlow. Our centre is open fortnightly (with exceptions) from 6:30pm to 8:00pm (Doors open 6:00pm).</p>
<p class="tsc-body">Most weeks there will be a raffle, charged at £1 a strip, which is called at the end and you are welcome to join us for a tea and biscuit after the service.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading-m">About Psychic and Pamper Fairs (Open Days)</h3>
<p class="tsc-body">Psychic and Pamper Fairs are held 3 times a year at the Hadlow Village Hall. They are held on a Saturday from 12pm to 5pm. We have 1-1 readings available, as well as a variety of stalls, including a stall from the centre, selling a variety of spiritual and non-spiritual items. We also have Reiki and other healers. There is also a big raffle at the end, again charged at £1 a strip.</p>
<h3 class="tsc-heading-m">About Evenings of Clairvoyance</h3>
<p class="tsc-body">Evenings of Clairvoyance are held 1 or 2 times a year and are events to either raise funds for the centre or for a charity of our choice. This event is longer than our Sunday Divine service and has charged entry in order to raise funds for the charity, as well as optional donations to the charity. We are visited by 2 guest mediums and there is a break in the middle for refreshments.</p>
